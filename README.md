### About Me

I am a PhD student in Computational Combustion Lab <a href="https://ccl.gatech.edu//" target="_blank"> (CCL)</a> of <a href="https://www.ae.gatech.edu/" target="_blank"> Aerospace Engineering department</a> at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia Tech</a>, largely interested in computational modelling of turbulent reacting flows. Towards these ends, I spend my time studying mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering and some mathematical courses that have helped me to build strong foundation in the area of computational sciences with particular attention to fluid dynamics, turbulence and combustion modelling.     

### Research Work

Much of my current thesis work revolves around modelling non volatile particulate matter (nVPM) formation from gas turbine engines.
